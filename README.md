# CS236 Final Project - Datalog Interpreter

This project is the final project for BYU's CS236 course, taught by Brett Decker, Spring 2021. It combines elements from the 5 main projects for the course to develop a complete interpreter for Datalog programs. It includes a Lexer, Parser, and Execution Engine.

## Project Overview

This interpreter, built in C++, uses concepts from discrete structures, finite-state machines, and object-oriented design. The interpreter has three main components:

- **Lexer**: Scans the input program file and generates a list of tokens.
- **Parser**: Interprets tokens to validate the program structure.
- **Execution Engine (interpreter)**: Executes commands based on the parsed Datalog program.

### Why Tokens?

Tokens make the program easier for the computer to process by converting user-defined elements into a structured format. Each token holds:
1. A token type (e.g., `STRING`).
2. The specific input segment (e.g., `"Hello World"`).
3. Line number information.

### Project Breakdown

This project builds on previous projects:
- **Project 1**: Build the Lexer.
- **Project 2**: Construct the Parser.
- **Projects 3-5**: Develop the Execution Engine.

## Components

### Lexer
The **Lexer** uses a finite-state machine approach to tokenize input, breaking it down into predefined structures while tracking line numbers. The Lexer implements the `Parallel and Max` algorithm, where each automaton checks input and reads the longest valid segment, generating a token based on that match.

### Parser
The **Parser** receives tokens from the Lexer, arranging them according to Datalogâ€™s rules. This component ensures the sequence of tokens conforms to the expected structure for the Datalog language, making the program interpretable by the Execution Engine.

### Interpreter
The **Interpreter** processes and executes the commands in the parsed Datalog program. It interacts with data structures based on the parsed input, outputting results or handling queries as defined by the program.
